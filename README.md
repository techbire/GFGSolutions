## Introduction

This repository serves as a personal collection of my solutions to DSA problems from GeeksforGeeks. It's intended to track my progress, help others who are learning, and serve as a reference for anyone interested in solving similar problems.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
GFG-DSA-Solutions
├── School
│   ├── Problem 1
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   └── problem1.cpp
├── Easy
│   ├── Problem 1
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   └── problem1.cpp
├── Medium
│   ├── Problem 1
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   └── problem1.cpp
├── Hard
│   ├── Problem 1
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   └── problem1.cpp
└── ...
```

- Each difficulty level (School, Easy, Medium, Hard) contains directories for individual problems.
- Each problem directory contains:
  - The C++ solution file (`.cpp`)
  - A `README.md` file with the problem statement and explanation of the solution
